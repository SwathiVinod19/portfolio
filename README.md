##### Acknowledgements
I'm new to web development altogether and I was a little confused about how flex works in css.. and I used the tutoring services along with Youtube videos to understand the basics of flex. I would like to thank my tutor Rene Trevino for exploring concepts of flex, looking at my html and css code.. and sharing helpful videos :) Grateful for the help and happy to be learning everyday !
